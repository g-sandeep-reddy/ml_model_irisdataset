It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Each sample has four features: the lengths and the widths of the sepals and petals.

Here's a brief overview of each species and the features:

Species
Iris setosa
Iris versicolor
Iris virginica
Features
1. Sepal Length (cm)
2. Sepal Width (cm)
3. Petal Length (cm)
4. Petal Width (cm)

Machine Learning enables computers to learn from the data and make 	decisions/predictions
Machine learning algorithms identify the patterns and relationships in data, allowing the system to improve its performance over time through experience
Steps involved in machine learning!
1) Data Collection
2) Data Processing
3) Chossing the model
4) Training the model
5) ) Evaluating the model
